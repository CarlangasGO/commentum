			<ol class="numbered-list">
				<li>Posting/sharing/viewing child pornography or "jailbait" (photos of young children in revealing attire posted/shared for sexual purposes).</li>
				<li>"Doxxing" -- releasing personal information about another in an attempt to inteimidate, harrass, or otherwise terrorize that individual.</li>
				<li>Rallying or calling to action support for a hate crime. While you are free to share your opinions on anything here on Commentum, we will not tolerate posts calling, literally, for the physical harm of a specific person or group of people based on race, religion, etc.</li>
