			<h5>DO</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Read the <a href="/p/rules_and_policies">Rules & Policies</a>!</strong>
					<i>
						Commentum harbors and encourages freedom of speech. There are very few things we will not allow. Anything illegal is not allowed.
						Reading our rules and policies ensures you know exactly what is off-limits.
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Remember you're talking to a person!</strong> 
					<i>
						If they say something that differs from your opinion; just because you can't see them, doesn't mean they don't have feelings,
						or that their opinion means less than yours! Be respectful and understanding!
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Behave just as you would in real life -- practice The Golden Rule!</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Try to have the source of a .GIF or other image when using something for context!</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Respect the rules and guidelines set by the tag(s) you're using!</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Post original content!</strong> 
					<i>
						Original Content separates us from the rest of the internet and allows us to offer something no one else yet has.
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Post to the most appropriate community possible!</strong> 
					<i>
						If the tag you need doesn't exist, and you're alright with taking the responsibility of modding it, create it!
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Proof read your submissions before posting!</strong>
					<i>
						We're online and not in a hurry! You will stand out more and look better if your posts read well.
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Read articles posted thoroughly before forming and sharing your opinion(s)!</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Report any posts, comments, or materials that break the <a href="/p/rules_and_policies">Rules & Policies</a> of Commentum!</strong>
					<i>
						We take infractions very seriously. You can reach us in a multitude of ways. Speak to your tag's mod, amd <a href="/p/contact">contact us directly</a>.
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Keep your personal opinions out of your submission titles!</strong>
					<i>
						This encourages open discussion and debate, rather than personal attacks on your opinion.
					</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Be active in the community!</strong>
					<i>
						Every bit of activity helps. The community runs on activity, so help your fellow Commenteurs build momentum!
					</i>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<hr>

			<h5>DON'T</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Engage in any illegal activity!</strong> 
				<i>
					A simple rule of thumb is, if it's illegal, it is against the <a href="/p/rules_and_policies">Rules & Policies</a> of Commentum.
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Post someones personal information/witch hunt!</strong> 
				<i>
					This includes not posting links to their personal pages like Facebook/Twitter. If you post a Social Media link, be sure to cover up
					the name(s), picture(s), and/or other personal information. This is considered Doxxing, which is against the <a href="/p/rules_and_policies">
					Rules & Policies</a>, and will result in a ban.
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Report a submission because you disagree with it!</strong>
				<i>
					The admins/mods have a lot of work to do; if the submission is not breaking any Commenciples or tag guidelines, reporting it will do nothing
					except waste time that could be better spent improving the community.
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Write titles in ALL CAPS, unless it makes sense to do so!</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Complain about reposts!</strong> 
				<i>
					Reposts, like them or not, allow everyone to enjoy the content that they may have otherwise missed.
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Complain about cross posts!</strong>
				<i>
					Commentum is a community site that allows you to subscribe to your favourtite tags. You may be subscribed to multiple tags 
					that allow you to see many cross-posts of said content. That does not mean everyone is subscribed to the same tags as you are,
					and they deserve the opportunity to see the post just as much as you do.
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Be a bad mod (if you are a mod)!</strong>
				<i>
					If you are not prepared to take on the responsibility of modding a community, don't take it on. If your personal opinions or 
					biases might interfere with your ability to effectively moderate, then don't.
				</i>
			</li>
